                <p>Growing up, I always had a passion for building and figuring out how things worked. This led to much of my high school career being focused around pursuing some form of engineering degree. By the time college rolled around, I had developed a strong interest in the action sports world, particularly skateboarding and snowboarding. These new hobbies led to me deciding to pursue a different tack, starting a business to make my hobbies my career.</p>
                <p>I attended the University of Wisconsin Stout and graduated in 2017 with a B.S in Retail Merchandising and Management, and a Minor in Business Administration. Throughout my time at UW-Stout, my favorite courses were those where I got the opportunity to use programs like Microsoft Excel and Access. I took both a logic and IT course towards the end of college and realized that, while I still loved snowboarding and skateboarding, what I was most interested in making a career out of was working with computers and solving problems. I saw that there was a benefit to combining the knowledge I gained with my business degree and the pursuit of a career in software development.</p>
                <p>Excited that I had rediscovered my interest in building and problem-solving, I put this professional goal on hold temporarily to pursue another one of my dreams: travel. So, after graduation, I set out on a 2-month long road trip to see the Western states. On this adventure, I visited Salt Lake City, UT and knew that I would have to come back out for the snowboarding. Just after the new year, I packed as much as I could into my car and moved out.</p>
                <p>I spent that winter working at Park City and Canyons Mountain Resorts in the Lift Operations and Activities departments, where I had the opportunity to snowboard every day without having to worry about affording a lift ticket. During the summers, I was a shift lead for a local restaurant, where I got to help with business operations, such as scheduling and revising business plans. It was during this time that I got the drive to revisit my passion and return to school for Computer Science. Although my existing student loans created a financial challenge to return to a 4-year University, I knew I needed to find a way into the software industry somehow, so I found a coding bootcamp called Helio Training. </p>
                <p>I enrolled in Helio’s Immersive Fullstack web development bootcamp to jumpstart my career in software development. I learned many technical skills in my time at Helio, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Apollo, GraphQL, GraphQL-yoga, Prisma, and MongoDB. My goal for the future is to use my experience with coding and development to eventually become a Software Engineer.</p>
                <p>Helio Training has provided me the technical skills I need to compliment by business degree and kick-off a career in development.  However, I maintain a student mindset and know there’s plenty more for me to learn in the world of web development, so I am looking into more web development certification courses.</p>

          <p>When I’m not coding, you would find me outside camping, hiking, skateboarding, snowboarding, or out on a road trip to some place I haven’t been before. On those days where I just want to kick back and stay inside, I’d be coding, gaming, or, as of recently, homebrewing beer.</p>
